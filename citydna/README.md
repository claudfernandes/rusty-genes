# SIMULATION
```bash
$ cargo run ./specs.csv ./cities.csv > ./output.csv

# ------------
# ./specs.csv
# ------------
debug_level, skip, iterations, population_size, crossover_probability, mutation_probability

where:
- debug_level: 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4
- skip: row in csv file will be written when iteration % skip == 0, should be unsigned integer >= 1
- iterations: unsigned integer
- population_size: should be an even integer and divisible by ten
- crossover_probability: between 0.0 and 1.0
- mutation_probability: between 0.0 and 1.0

# ------------
# ./cities.csv
# ------------
id1, x1, y1
id2, x2, y2
# --- snip ---
idn, xn, yn

# ------------
# ./output.csv
# ------------
iteration_step, number_of_cities, champion_fitness, challenger_fitness, champion_dna, challenger_dna

# JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS FOR SEMI RANDOM CITY GENERATION AND ANIMATED VISUALIZATION
- **IMPORTANT**: When running the simulation:
  - Use `debug_level = 1` to generate output `csv` file compatible with the helper scripts that you can use
  for your own notebooks
- To launch notebooks, check this [how-to](./notebooks/README.md) to set up your conda environment
- To launch a visual animation of the the search checkout [EXAMPLE 2 of the second section of this markdown](./notebooks/README.md), you can use the helper function `simulate()` with pre-generated city configuations and corresponding outputs that can be found in the `./data` directory (see SAMPLE DATA section below)
- To create `csv` files of semi-random cities with [[EXAMPLE 1 of the second section of this markdown](./notebooks/README.md)

# SAMPLE DATA
- Check the [`./data/`](./data/) directory for sample `csv` files used directly with the notebooks
- `csv` files in [`./data/output/`](./data/output/) directory used in the notebooks were generated by running the simulation (see next section)
- `csv` files in [`./data/cities/`](./data/cities/) directory are mostly generated with [EXAMPLE 1 of the second section of this markdown](./notebooks/README.md),
