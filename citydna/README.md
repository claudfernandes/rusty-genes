# INTRODUCTION
- An Rust implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem with animated visualization (jupyter notebook)
- See my Medium article for a more detailed discussion

# GETTING STARTED
```bash
$ cargo test -- --nocapture
$ cargo build
$ cargo run ./data/specs/specs1.csv ./data/cities/cities0.csv
```

# SAMPLE USAGE, KNOWN ISSUES, AND FUTURE FEATURES
- See [`SAMPLECODE1.md`](./docs/SAMPLECODE1.md) and [`SAMPLECODE2.md`](./docs/SAMPLECODE2.md) in [`docs`](./docs) 
  directory for sample code
- See `TODO.md` in `docs` directory for known issues and future features

# JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS FOR SEMI RANDOM CITY GENERATION AND ANIMATED VISUALIZATION
- **IMPORTANT**: When running the simulation:
  - Use `debug_level = 1` to generate output `csv` file compatible with the notebooks
- To launch the notebooks, check this [how-to](./notebooks/README.md) to set up your conda environment
- Launch a visual animation of the the search  with [`n1-simple-example.ipynb`](./notebooks/n1a-simple-example.ipynb)
- Create `csv` files of semi-random cities with [`n2-readwrite-csv.ipynb`](./notebooks/n2-readwrite-csv.ipynb)

# SAMPLE DATA
- Check the [`./data/`](./data/) directory for sample `csv` files used directly with the notebook
- `csv` files in [`./data/output/`](./data/output/) directory used in the notebooks were generated by running the simulation (see next section)
- `csv` files in [`./data/cities/`](./data/cities/) directory are generated with [`n2-readwrite-csv.ipynb`](./notebooks/n2-readwrite-csv.ipynb)

# SIMULATION
```bash
$ cargo run ./specs.csv ./cities.csv > ./output.csv

# ------------
# ./specs.csv
# ------------
debug_level, skip, iterations, population_size, crossover_probability, mutation_probability

where:
- debug_level: 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4
- skip: row in csv file will be written when iteration % skip == 0, should be unsigned integer >= 1
- iterations: unsigned integer
- population_size: should be an even integer and divisible by ten
- crossover_probability: between 0.0 and 1.0
- mutation_probability: between 0.0 and 1.0

# ------------
# ./cities.csv
# ------------
id1, x1, y1
id2, x2, y2
# --- snip ---
idn, xn, yn

# ------------
# ./output.csv
# ------------
iteration_step, number_of_cities, champion_fitness, challenger_fitness, champion_dna, challenger_dna
# --- snip ---
